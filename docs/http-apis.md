# HTTP APIs

## Definitions

- **Resource** - An important thingy you want to expose through your API
- **URI** - a name for a resource (Uniform Resource Identifier)
- **METHOD** - Resources have a fixed set of methods. You can't make them up. See below.
- **Representation** - A projection of the state of a resource at a particular point in time.
- **Media Type** - A specific format for a representation, like `application/json`, `text/html`, etc.

## Http Resources

Two basic categories.

- **Document** - Represents a specific instance of a resource. e.g. `/customers/bob-smith`
- **Collection** - Represents a group of related resources. e.g. `/customers`

Documents are usually *subordinate* resources to a collection, but documents can also have subordinate resources that are either documents
or collections.

Examples:

`/customers/bob-smith/address` - the address data for Bob Smith.
`/customers/bob-smith/sales-rep` - Bob's sales representative (could be an alias to `/employees/jill-jones`)

Collection resources can be filtered using a query string argument:

- `GET /customers` - returns all customers
- `GET /customers?state=KY` - returns just the customers in Kentucky


## Http Methods

| Method | Description | Resource Type | Example | Safe | Idempotent | Cacheable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | Retreive a representation | Document | `GET /customers/bob-smith` | True | True | True |
| GET | Retreive a representation | Collection | `GET /customers/` | True | True | True |
| POST | Submit an Entity For Processing | Document | `POST /customers/bob-smith/credit` | False | False | False |
| POST | Consider Adding this as a subordinate resource | Collection | `POST /customers` | False | False | False* |
| PUT | Replace (or upsert) this document | Document | `PUT /customers/bob-smith/email-address` | False | True | False |
| PUT | Replace this collection | Collection | `PUT /customers` | False | True | False |
| DELETE | Remove this document | Document | `DELETE /customers/bob-smith/` | False | True | False |
| DELETE | Remove this collection | Collection | `DELETE /customers/` | False | True | False |

:::note 
Rarely do you support `DELETE` or `PUT` on a collection, and rarely do you support `POST` on a document

### Properties

- **Safe** - means there are no "side effects" - nothing about the business changes because of this operation.
- **Idempotent** - Doing it multiple times has the same effect as doing it once.
- **Cacheable** - Responses from this operation should have cache headers indicating their reuse constraints.
